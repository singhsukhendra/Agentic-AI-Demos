Agentic AI refers to AI systems that autonomously perceive their environment, reason about it, make decisions, and take actions toward achieving goals â€” often without human intervention at each step.

They are agents because they:

Sense: Gather data about the environment.

Think: Process data and decide what to do.

Act: Change the environment via actions.

Learn & Adapt: Improve over time from feedback
